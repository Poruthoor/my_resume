___

Please feel free to find my current resume by opening `resume.pdf`

I used the template given [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc) as the base template and heavily modified it.

Please feel free to use this as a template, if you want.

All the logos used in the resume are taken from the offical logo bundles of the respective brands given below:

1. [LinkedIn](https://brand.linkedin.com/content/brand/global/en_us/index/visual-identity/logo)
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/logos)

##### 1. How to strip active components?
   
Some company portals might ask you to strip off active components from your resume to be uploaded correctly. Active components refers to any active embedded objects. When you make such a pdf, you are essentially losing any hyperlinks, etc. Hence first make a resume version without any hyperlinks. Then strip the remaining active components using following methods:
   

   a. [Fast, easy, and best if you created the pdf from scratch](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/469749)
   
   b. [Again, fast, and best if you created the pdf from scratch](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/554700)
   
   c. [Not so fast but more safe approach, if you are unsure about the origin of your pdf](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/481609)
